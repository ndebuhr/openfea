Assumptions
Truss element displacement is approximated by 1D linear function - therefore, constant stress and strain throughout truss element
Hooke's law assumptions (small displacement, linear elasticity)

Notes
Solution generated through numerical means
Solver employes a finite element method approach, with "Penalty Method" numerically implementation
